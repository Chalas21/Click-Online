The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the Click Online application, an MVP for one-to-one video calls with a token-based payment system. The work began by thoroughly understanding the product requirements and clarifying essential external integrations (payment gateway, SMS, email) and MVP priorities. The engineer then proceeded with an iterative approach, first scaffolding the application with  for the core React frontend and FastAPI backend. Subsequent steps involved extensive testing using a  to validate implemented features like authentication, user/professional dashboards, and the token system. Crucially, the engineer identified and addressed issues, specifically a WebSocket connectivity problem and authentication errors, before providing a detailed summary of the successfully implemented functionalities, the technical stack, and pending tasks. The focus remained on delivering the core professional catalog with video calling as prioritized by the user.

<product_requirements>
The Click Online application is designed as a web-based one-to-one video call platform connecting users with professionals. It features end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) video and chat, a token-based payment system where users buy tokens and transfer them to professionals per minute (configurable rate). A minimum fee is required to initiate a call, non-refundable if the call is short. The platform supports a virtual queue for busy professionals, with initial queue fees being refundable upon cancellation. User registration requires email and phone verification, and professionals withdrawing earnings must undergo KYC. The primary MVP goal was the professional catalog with video calling, with payment via Brazilian PIX, SMS via a local Brazilian provider, and email via SendGrid, all using Emergent integrations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), WebSocket (real-time communication), JWT (authentication).
-   **Communication:** WebRTC (video calls), Signal Protocol (E2EE chat), bcrypt (password hashing).
-   **Infra/Services:** coturn (TURN/STUN), Redis (queues/presence), PostgreSQL (ledger â€“ though MongoDB was used in implementation).
-   **Integrations:** Brazilian PIX, SendGrid, Local Brazilian SMS provider (via Emergent integrations).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB as the primary database.



-   :
    -   **Summary:** This file serves as the core of the FastAPI backend application. It contains the API endpoints for user authentication (signup, login, logout), user/professional profile management, token management (purchase, transfer, withdrawal), call initiation, acceptance, and termination, and WebSocket handling for real-time communication. It also likely includes database interaction logic with MongoDB and JWT token generation/validation.
    -   **Changes Made:** The file was completely rewritten using  to establish the foundational backend logic and endpoints for the MVP, including authentication, token handling, and call management. It was further modified to address WebSocket and authentication (403 Forbidden) issues.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This is the main React component responsible for rendering the application's user interface. It handles routing between different views (login, registration, user dashboard, professional dashboard, call screen, wallet), manages component state, and interacts with the FastAPI backend via API calls (using ).
    -   **Changes Made:** This file was completely rewritten via  to implement the initial UI structure, routing, and component integration for the MVP's user and professional flows, including login, registration, dashboards, and the call interface.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This file contains custom CSS styles, likely utilizing Tailwind CSS directives, to define the visual appearance of the application's components and layout, complementing the global  and shadcn/ui components.
    -   **Changes Made:** Rewritten using  to establish initial styling for the application, adhering to modern UI/UX guidelines and Tailwind patterns.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** Contains global Tailwind CSS base, components, and utilities imports, along with custom CSS variables (, ) for theming (light/dark mode) and base styles for  and  elements. This file sets up the primary color palette and typography.
    -   **Changes Made:** Content provided in the initial environment setup. No explicit changes mentioned in the trajectory, serving as a foundational stylesheet.

-   :
    -   **Summary:** This directory contains pre-built shadcn/ui components (e.g., , , , ). These components are utilized by  and other React components to construct the application's UI, ensuring a consistent and modern design language.
    -   **Changes Made:** These are pre-existing components provided. The AI engineer was instructed to use these components, implying their integration into  and other UI logic, rather than direct modification of the component files themselves.

<pending_tasks>
-   **WebSocket Real-time:** Fix and stabilize WebSocket connections for reliable real-time notifications.
-   **External Integrations:** Implement PIX (payment), SendGrid (email), and a local Brazilian SMS provider using Emergent integrations.
-   **Verifications:** Implement full email and SMS verification flows for user registration.
-   **Advanced Functionalities:** Develop the virtual waiting queue, user rating system, and detailed call history.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The MVP of Click Online is largely implemented and ready for demonstration. The core functionality of a professional catalog with video calling is operational.

**Implemented Features:**
-   **Authentication:** Complete user and professional registration, login/logout, JWT-based token management, and role differentiation.
-   **Professional Dashboard:** Professionals can control their online/offline status, view their specialization, price per minute, token balance, and a message indicating they are Aguardando chamadas....
-   **User Dashboard:** Displays a list of available professionals with detailed information, buttons to initiate calls, and the user's token balance.
-   **Token System:** Users start with 100 tokens. The system handles per-minute charging during calls, applies a minimum fee of 10 tokens to initiate a call, and transfers 85% of tokens to professionals (after platform fees).
-   **Call API:** Backend endpoints for initiating, accepting/rejecting, and ending calls, including automatic cost calculation and call history.
-   **WebRTC Video Interface:** A functional in-call interface with local and remote video streams, a chat feature, and controls to hang up calls.

**Technical Aspects:**
The application is built with a FastAPI backend, MongoDB database, React frontend, and utilizes WebSocket for real-time communication, JWT for secure authentication, and WebRTC for P2P video calls. Password hashing is done with bcrypt.

**Current State & Nuances:**
The fundamental user and professional flows, from registration to initiating and managing a call, are working. Screenshots confirm the UI for registration and dashboards. Backend API tests showed a 75% success rate, indicating most core endpoints are functional. However, there's a known issue with the WebSocket for real-time notifications that still needs to be fully resolved, as suggested by the failed tests and the flow_error.jpeg screenshot. The external integrations (PIX, SendGrid, SMS) are planned but not yet implemented.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to address and fully correct the WebSocket real-time connection issues.
